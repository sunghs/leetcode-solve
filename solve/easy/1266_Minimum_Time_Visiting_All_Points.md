On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. 

Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.

You can move according to these rules:

- In 1 second, you can either:
  - move vertically by one unit,
  - move horizontally by one unit, or
  - move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
- You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
- You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.

### Examples:
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds


Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
```

### Constraints:
- points.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 100
- points[i].length == 2
- -1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000

    public int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(int[][] points) {

            int x1 = points[i][0];
            int y1 = points[i][1];
            int x2 = points[i + 1][0];
            int y2 = points[i + 1][1];

            // 대각선으로 움직임

                }
